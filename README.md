1. Introduction.

This white paper introduces the idea of the Greenhouse DAO.
This is an autonomous, collaborative organisation whose objective would be to unite investors around the concept of attributing a monetary value to the Social Cost of Carbon SCC.
This idea is based on attributing a value to sources of income derived in the long-term from investments in all sectors of economy whose activity results in the reduction of Greenhous Gases GHG emissions.
In the scenario adopted by Greenhouse DAO we assume that investments in climate are beneficial and should be implemented immediately. 
They should start from the highest level of estimated GHG costs and are gradually adapted in order to encourage the maximum possible reduction of emissions by 2100.
The value attributed would be inversely proportional to the value proposed in the estimates of the SCC which vary between 200 - 1025$ in most publications.(1, 2, 3, 4)
Government research and syntheses of various cases of the interaction of all the elements modeling every aspect of climate change reveal that it is extremely difficult to estimate the consequences of climate change and just as difficult to put a price tag on the impact this change will have on the economy.  
In order to achieve this the Greenhouse DAO would emit Carbon Tokens CT.
The price of Carbon Token could be fixed at ≥ 1025 $/t CO2, chosen so as to attract investors to the project.
The Carbon Token can be defined as an economic tool whose role would be to accelerate the process of energetic transition.
This value may seem high at first glance, however it comes from scenarios foreseeing GHG influence on the economics of the environment - better to prevent than cure
Carbon Tokens would be emitted in two phases.


2. The Greenhouse DAO, two stages in the emission of CT’s :

Stage I. Pre-sales 
The objective of the pre-sale stage is the empowerment of a Greenhouse DAO and the development of the first DAPP applications for the management of future energy emissions and energy saving. 
Within the pre-sale stage (until stage 2) the value of Carbon Token (unlimited units) can be :
For the holders of  DAO tokens :
1 or 10 DT = 1 CT
For ETH holders :
1 CT = 0,52 ETH*
*At the current market price at the time of publication of this white paper 5,79 $/t CO2 EU ETS.

Stage II. Introduction on the free market.
Introduction of CT on USN and EC. In this phase the energy consumers and producers become the issuers of Carbon Tokens.
This is a milestone in the birth of a Greenhouse DAO, a stage in which DAPPs are launched through USN and the EC. We now begin to collect and analyze data on GHG emissions. Investments leading to economic activity which effectively reduces pollution are paid for in CTs, manufacturers of energy and its users have become emitters of carbon tokens.
1 CT = 1 ton of emission reduction GEC, price explained at the outset. (le prix expliqué dans l'introduction)


3. Carbon Tokens become economic levers.

Examples of Greenhouse gas reductions compensated by CT's :
    
In transport: the use of electric and hybrid vehicles, car sharing, public transport, bicycles; in this context the new DAPPs would facilitate the transition.

In the construction of housing, passive buildings with close to zero carbon emissions as well as building contributing to energy production would be encouraged.

In agriculture,  CTs would support the development of, for exemple permacultures and other forms of production resulting in a decreasing amount of emissions or zero emissions.

These are just three examples which illustrate how to put the model into practice. In each case there is an enormous potential which could result in / lead to the origin of autonomous, innovative organisations linked to the Greenhouse DAOs.

  The expectation of the company Sas Seeds concept in the future of this project is :

Providing expertise on new solutions concerning Greenhouse DAOs and DAPPs on the general USN sharing network and the Ethereum computer.
In the future, taking part in the development of research on the effects of GEC. These studies will be/ would be helpful in estimating costs of gas emission.

I hope that the proposal of Greenhouse DAO will meet with great interest, I would like to invite you to discuss and initiate investment in Carbon Token within USN and EC .
